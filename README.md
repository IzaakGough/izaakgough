### What I'm interested in 

- #### Programming problems

    I enjoy solving programming problems in a few different places:
    
    - LeetCode
    - Project Euler
    - Codewars

- #### Video games
    I enjoy playing a variety of genres of video game: fps, rpg, fighting games and factory simulation games (factorio/satisfactory).

    I am also an avid speedrunner. I mainly speedrun goldsource engine games, in particular Half-life and one of its expansions Half-Life: Opposing Force.
    
- #### Chess
    Whilst I am terrible at this game, I still enjoy playing it and thinking about it. I enjoy solving chess puzzles more than playing games (probably because I'm bad). I am trying to get better...

- #### Mathematical problems/puzzles

    I enjoy solving a wide range of mathematical problems and puzzles. These vary massively in difficulty and flavour. Some examples are problems from: 
       
    -  [UKMT](https://ukmt.org.uk)
    - [STEP](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/admissions/step) 
    - [TMUA](https://esat-tmua.ac.uk/about-the-tests/tmua-test/)
    
    I also have some random books which have some nice problems:

    - [Challenging Problems in Geometry](https://www.isinj.com/mt-usamo/Challenging%20Problems%20In%20Geometry%20Alfred%20Posamentier.pdf)

    - [Inside Interesting Integrals](https://galoisian.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/undergraduate-lecture-notes-in-physics-paul-j-nahin-inside-interesting-integrals-2015-springer-1.pdf)
    
    - [(Almost) Impossible Integrals, Sums, and Series](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/almost_impossible_integrals_sums_and_series_by_valean_cornel_ioan_z-lib.org_.pdf)
